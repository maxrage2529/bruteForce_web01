# Notes Making Application
This is Submission project from Team Brute Force in track 1 Web for DevLok.
DevLok was a competition that took place in Army Institute of Technology,Pune , conducted by AIT Open Source Software Club to encourage students to learn something new. There were many tracks in this event which involved creating projects in different fields like web development, AI/ML, android development. We chose Track 1 which was web development where we had to crearte a Note Taking Web App. 
A note taking app sounds simple where you just keep adding notes which is kinda like todo app but in reality we can experiment a lot and can develop a far better product which users can feel like using.
Our app follows a notebook structure which is like a real notebook, you have a notebook and inside it you create notes. This helps in easy management of notes according to topics. 
Our overall experience in this event was awesome. We got to learn a lot of new things and we finally rose up from tutorial hell and created something of our own without watching youtube tutorial on how to make a note taking applicationðŸ˜‰.
